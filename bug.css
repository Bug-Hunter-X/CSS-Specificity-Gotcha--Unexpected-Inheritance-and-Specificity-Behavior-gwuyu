The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green; /* This rule will likely not work as expected */
}
```

The intended behavior is that paragraphs (`<p>`) inside a `div` element should have green text. However, due to CSS specificity rules, the `div p` selector might not override the `p` selector.  This is because the `p` selector is more specific than `div p` when both apply.

The `p` selector has a specificity of 0,1,0 while the `div p` has a specificity of 0,1,1. But because the `p` selector is inherited from the universal selector and also has a higher specificity, the rule might not apply unless we add another class in the `div` element.  This is a subtle point that many developers miss.
