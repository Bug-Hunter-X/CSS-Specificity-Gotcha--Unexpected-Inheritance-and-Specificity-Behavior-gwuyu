To solve this issue, we need to increase the specificity of the rule targeting paragraphs within divs. Here are a few ways:

1. **Increase Specificity with Class:** Add a class to the `div` and target that class in the selector:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

.container p {
  color: green; /* Now this rule will override the `p` selector */
}
```

2. **More Specific Selector:** Use a more specific selector like `div > p` to target only direct children of the `div`:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div > p {
  color: green; /*This also increases the specificity*/
}
```

3. **Use !important (Least Recommended):** Although generally discouraged, the `!important` flag can override other rules.

```css
div p {
  color: green !important; /* This will override other rules, but avoid unless necessary */
}
```

Choosing the right solution depends on the context of your CSS, but understanding inheritance and specificity is crucial for predictable results.
